His reputation for chivalry developed from his habits of never robbing a woman, never harming his victims (except the Pelican, a thoroughly unpleasant cattle-duffer who was responsible for his serving a term of imprisonment), of guiding women-travelers on their journey,and of returning what he had stolen in hold-ups if he found the people he had robbed were in poor circumstances. Annie Rixon calls him Australia’s Robin Hood."
