<div><div data-schema-version="8"><p><strong>Initial Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the cadaver picture, just with his hat included, not 
really a positive portrayal of Thunderbolt. I’am curious as to why they 
put his hat back on.</p>
<p><strong>Structured Analysis</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why was the image taken?</p>
<p>Andrew Cunningham (Armidales photographer in 1870) was reporting on the events of Frederick Wards death.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the image portray Thunderbolt?</p>
<p>A primary source of Thunderbolt. The photo actually is of Frederick 
Ward, though in death. He looks almost tired, grimy and rough. He is 
wearing his hat, an iconic characteristic of Thunderbolt in later 
pictures.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the mood of the image? What feeling does it convey?</p>
<p>A very solemn mood is conveyed. Shocked feelings due to the way his body is displayed and in such a public way.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What insights does it provide for the case study?</p>
<p>The public apparently flocked to both see Thunderbolts body and 
newspapers were printing this photo. The public seemed to be in shock 
and disbelief that this national identity, who seemed larger than life 
was now dead. Brings some realism to the public instead of the over 
indulged stories of Thunderbolt that are included in the case study. 
Though his death is further capitalised on as we see in other historic 
images.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was the image staged or natural?</p>
<p>The photo is both staged and natural. Staged as Thunderbolt obviously
 was propped up and put on display. Natural in that the photo is of a 
real individual.</p>

<p>Movie poster promoting the movie Captain Thunderbolt in 1955. The 
desperado or hero line correlates a more dramatic playout of his life 
and romance.</p>
<p><strong>Structured Analysis</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why was the image taken or produced?</p>
<p>This photo is an advertisement/poster of the 1953/55 film Captain 
Thunderbolt. It was created to promote the screening of this movie. </p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the image portray Thunderbolt?</p>
<p>Thunderbolt is played by an attractive and heroic actor (Grant 
Taylor). He seems stoic, handsome and charismatic all in the one image. </p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the mood of the image? What feeling does it convey?</p>
<p>The image conveys a bold mood, with the themes of a valiant outlaw 
being heavily portrayed through large capped text and the actors brave 
and serious body language and expressions. </p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What insights does it provide for the case study?</p>
<p>Highlights direct modern interpretations of Thunderbolts life and how
 the film industry used this concept to address social issues at the 
time. </p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was the image staged or natural?</p>
<p>Image was staged with the purpose of appealing to the public. This 
would increase movie ticket sales and make it a more attractive sell. 
Bold lettering, well known actors and a heroic figure make for a 
thrilling movie poster.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Why was the image taken/created?</p>
<p>Created by Sydney newspaper to illustrate the capture of Captain Thunderbolt. Does not show his death.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the image portray Thunderbolt?</p>
<p>Portrays Thunderbolt fleeing from Walker. Running instead of 
fighting, with his horse in the throws of death in the background. 
Walkers positioning automatically gives him the higher ground, linking 
to connections of superiority of law enforcement.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the mood of the image? What feeling does it convey?</p>
<p>The image conveys a feeling of success, on the part of the local 
police. They finally had Thunderbolt on the run and fleeing from them, 
instead of Thunderbolt always seeming to have the upper hand and 
escaping.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What insights does it provide for the case study?</p>
<p>Highlights an interesting spin on the events that lead to the capture
 and death of Thunderbolt. He doesn’t appear to be aiming back, which is
 known from walkers accounts to have happened.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was the image staged or natural?</p>
<p>A staged drawing based on real events. </p>

<div><div data-schema-version="8"><p><strong>Initial Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Provides a historically accurate portrayal of Constable Walker. Gives
 context the individual who was the one too kill/capture Thunderbolt.</p>
<p><strong>Structured Analysis</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why was the image taken?</p>
<p>The photo was taken by the only photographer in Armidale at the time 
of Wards death in 1870. Andrew Cunningham wanted to record the events of
 the bushrangers death (Messner, 2018). The photo was more than likely 
taken to have a record of the Constable who pursued and killed 
Thunderbolt. </p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the image portray Thunderbolt?</p>
<p>The photo doesn’t directly portray the Australian bushranger. 
Provides a primary source of the person responsible for apprehending 
Thunderbolt.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the mood of the image? What feeling does it convey?</p>
<p>The photo like the Mary Ann Bugg portrait, has a very serious mood 
reminiscent of the 1800s style of portrait photography. Alexander 
Walkers stances is very official and posed, conveying the feeling of a 
formal photograph of importance. Cunningham seemed to want to produce a 
serious photographic record of the man who brought down the famous 
Thunderbolt. </p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What insights does it provide for the case study?</p>
<p>Provides the viewer with a visualisation of the famous Constable 
Walker. Portrays him as just a man, without the ‘evil’ law enforcement 
tag that many of the dramatised renditions of Thunderbolts death seem to
 contain. Links to research questions of interpretation from secondary 
perspectives. </p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was the image staged or natural?</p>
<p>The portrait was staged, with props such as the chair, Walkers 
posture and the background setting providing the photo with a formal 
characterisation. </p>
</li>

<p>Captain Thunderbolts wife, Mary Ann Buggs. Gaps in what year this 
photo was taken, by who and where, so all thats available is her name to
 the photo.</p>
<p><strong>Structured Analysis</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why was the image taken?</p>
<p>This photo seems to most likely have been taken as a portrait of 
Captain Thunderbolts partner Mary Ann Buggs. It could have been taken at
 her request. She does seem to have dressed well for the occasion Maybe 
it was a photo for Frederick Ward himself, though this is playing 
heavily on the romance between the two and is just an outer secondary 
perspective.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the image portray Thunderbolt?</p>
<p>The image isn’t directly related to Thunderbolt. The photo provides 
more context for the people who surrounded Thunderbolt, illustrating the
 background information that the case study includes.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the mood of the image? What feeling does it convey?</p>
<p>Though the photo is a self portrait, it has a very solemn mood. This 
is a characteristic of photographs of the times (Diamond, 2019). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What insights does it provide for the case study?</p>
<p>This photo does not provide significant direct insights into the case
 study of Thunderbolts crimes representations on digital and historical 
platforms. It’s role in this collection was to provide contextual images
 relating to individuals who were especially significant to Thunderbolt.
 As Mary Ann Buggs was his partner and the mother of his children the 
inclusion of this image is valid.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was the image staged or natural?</p>
<p>The photo was staged for personal use. The way she is standing, with 
her arm propped on a chair is a classic characterisation of portraits in
 the 1800s. The background is a staged setting to give the photo an air 
of seriousness and regality.</p>

<div><div data-schema-version="8"><p><strong>Initial Analysis</strong></p>
<p>As Walker is the only eye witness, the details of the drawings can 
sometimes stray from the original story. Is this for dramatic effect?</p>
<p><strong>Structured Analysis</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why was the image taken/created?</p>
<p>To illustrate the death of the Australian bushranger Captain Thunderbolt in published news articles.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the image portray Thunderbolt?</p>
<p>Portrays Thunderbolt as a bearded typical Australian bushman with the
 cattlemans hat. Two guns around his waist and one failing from his 
hand. Death through a duel comes to mind. Thunderbolt has a shocked look
 on his face.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the mood of the image? What feeling does it convey?</p>
<p>The image has a very disbelieving and sudden mood to it. Like the 
illustrators wants to convey that Thunderbolt did not see his death 
coming like this.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What insights does it provide for the case study?</p>
<p>Gives insight into how the contemporary newspapers at the time 
portrayed Thunderbolts death. Interesting to see what details were 
missed or drawn incorrectly. Special focus on the amount of weapons 
Thunderbolt is carrying in correlation with Walkers report of him only 
having one jammed gun. What does this say about local and state 
perceptions of Thunderbolt?</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was the image staged or natural?</p>
<p>Definitely a staged image. There was only one eye witness to 
Thunderbolts death, so the illustrator would have been creating this 
image from what information they had on the reports by Walker and their 
own interpretation of those reports.</p>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Uralla celebrates its association with the bushranger known as
 Captain Thunderbolt (Frederick Ward - 1835-1870) with a large statue of
 the outlaw on a horse in the main street, a grave in the local cemetery
 and the Thunderbolt Exhibition in McCrossin's Mill Gallery. Add to this
 a plaque to Constable Walker, who shot and killed Thunderbolt, and it 
is clear that much of the local tourism is focussed around this 
&amp;quot;gentleman&amp;quot; bushranger.
Ward was born at Windsor in 1835. He was working as a drover and 
horse-breaker on the Paterson River when he was arrested for receiving 
75 horses and sentenced to ten years hard labour on 13 August, 1856. He 
was sent to the gaol on Cockatoo Island in Sydney Harbour and was 
released from there in 1860 but in 1861 he was captured and sentenced 
again for horse theft. On 11 September, 1863 he escaped from Cockatoo 
Island and fled towards Bourke where his wife and two children were 
living. For the next six and a half years he robbed mail coaches, as 
well as roadside inns, stores and private homes from Maitland to the 
Queensland border and west to Bourke. At times he worked with 
accomplices but, because of the great advantage of his superior skills 
as a horseman, he often worked alone. By 1870 there was a reward of £550
 for him.
His exploits included the attempted robbery of the Merton Mail and 
Tollhouse at Lochinvar in 1863; the robbery of race patrons and 
publicans and the Campbell Hill Toll Gate at Rutherford; from 1865 to 
1870 his spate of robberies (86 in total) in the western district, the 
northwest slopes and plains the upper Hunter and the country towards the
 Queensland border are well covered in Court documents. Thunderbolt 
acquired a reputation as a gentleman. It was said he was always polite, 
particularly to women, and he never killed anybody. He was also very 
sensible. He never attempted to rob a place where the police were 
located and he avoided armed coaches. Consequently his reputation was 
more connected with his bravery and his skill as a horseman than with 
his violence.

<div><div data-schema-version="8"><p><strong>Initial Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Shows Thunderbolt is a largely celebrated part of the areas local history. Not the product of a hated criminal.</p>
<p><strong>Structured Analysis</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why was the image taken?</p>
<p>This photo was taken to commemorate the town of Uralla’s association 
with Frederick Ward (Captain Thunderbolt). A statue itself was 
constructed as a bicentenary project (<em>Captain Thunderbolt | Monument Australia</em>, n.d.). </p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the image portray Thunderbolt?</p>
<p>Captain Thunderbolt is portrayed in a very heroic way. The fact that 
he is positioned on a horse correlates well with his fame as a expert 
horsemen and tendency to steal horses. </p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the mood of the image? What feeling does it convey?</p>
<p>The photos produces a respectful and informative mood and feeling. 
Probably for the purpose to educate and provide an accurate source for 
the viewer.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What insights does it provide for the case study?</p>
<p>Links well to the case study in terms of modern interpretations and 
representations of Frederick Ward. Highlights how digital technology has
 been implemented to provide access to local historical stories.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was the image staged or natural?</p>
<p>The photo is quite obviously staged in a natural setting. The angle 
and lighting ensuring that the point of focus (the statue) was 
photographed in the most optimal way. </p>

<div><div data-schema-version="8"><p><strong>Initial Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Provides imagery to the stories of Thunderbolt ambushing people from 
this rock. Interesting that he could continually use this place over his
 bushranging years.</p>
<p><strong>Structured Analysis</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why was the image taken?</p>
<p>The photo was taken on by the authors family, apparently one a 
vacation when they were younger. The once popular ambush point has 
become a popular tourist destination and is covered in graffiti, so the 
public both respects and defiles the old monument to the ‘gentleman’ 
bushranger. </p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the image portray Thunderbolt?</p>
<p>While not portraying Thunderbolt directly, he is linked to the photo 
by the clear sign at the forefront of the rock. The fame the Thunderbolt
 name has procured ever since his death has resulted in his life 
becoming an attraction for tourism and historical tours.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the mood of the image? What feeling does it convey?</p>
<p>The photo has a very nostalgic mood, with the film imagery conveying 
the age of the photo. The people in the photo seem care free, walking 
onto the top of Big Rock and posing for a happy family photo at the once
 common ambush location.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What insights does it provide for the case study?</p>
<p>The mood and most likely reasoning behind this photo being taken 
correlate to the research topics questions and known knowledge. It is 
known that the public knowledge of Captain Thunderbolt is more 
romanticised by the representation of him in media and published 
literature. This photo is evidence of how this interpretation has 
impacted how the historical events are showcased to the public and what 
the public do with this.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was the image staged or natural?</p>
<p>The photo of Big Rock from the 1960s, was staged in the way a family 
stages for holiday photos. The intent behind it would have been for 
memory rather than an primary source or historical image curation. This 
provides us with a filter of personality to the photo rather than a 
clean and clinical one.</p>

<div><div data-schema-version="8"><p><strong>Initial Analysis</strong></p>
<p>A primary source of Thunderbolts body after he was shot by Constable 
Walker in 1870. It produces a sadden feeling, seeing his body displayed 
like this with the bullet wounds visible.</p>
<p><strong>Structured Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Basically the same picture as the Cadaver of Frederick Ward, only 
difference is in this one Thunderbolt is not pictured wearing his hat, 
so the analysis is the same except for some extra unique ideas. Unsure 
why this is, most likely to capture and image of his head without the 
hat covering any details. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why was the image taken?</p>
<p>Andrew Cunningham (Armidales photographer in 1870) was reporting on the events of Frederick Wards death.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the image portray Thunderbolt?</p>
<p>A primary source of Thunderbolt. The photo actually is of Frederick 
Ward, though in death. He looks almost tired, grimy and rough. The way 
his eyes are dropped seems like his is sleeping and then as you pan 
lower the bullet wounds are obvious showing his body was inflicted with 
serious trauma.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the mood of the image? What feeling does it convey?</p>
<p>A very solemn mood is conveyed. Shocked feelings due to the way his body is displayed and in such a public way.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What insights does it provide for the case study?</p>
<p>The public apparently flocked to both see Thunderbolts body and 
newspapers were printing this photo. The public seemed to be in shock 
and disbelief that this national identity, who seemed larger than life 
was now dead. Brings some realism to the public instead of the over 
indulged stories of Thunderbolt that are included in the case study. 
Though his death is further capitalised on as we see in other historic 
images.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was the image staged or natural?</p>
<p>The photo is both staged and natural. Staged as Thunderbolt obviously
 was propped up and put on display. Natural in that the photo is of a 
real individual.</p>
